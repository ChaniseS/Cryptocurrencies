# Cryptocurrencies
## Purpose:
We were asked to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.The data we will be working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what we are looking for, it is decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we decided on a clustering algorithm. Weâ€™ll use data visualizations to share relevant findings with the board of Accountability Accounting.

## Results:
### Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
